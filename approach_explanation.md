# Document Intelligence System: Approach Explanation

Our solution implements a persona-driven document analysis system that processes PDF documents and extracts relevant information based on the given persona and their job. Here's how our approach works:

## Core Components

1. **Document Processing**
   - Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for efficient PDF parsing
   - Implements section detection using text analysis and formatting cues
   - Extracts content while maintaining document structure

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Utilizes spaCy for text analysis
   - Employs the lightweight 'en_core_web_sm' model to stay within size constraints
   - Performs named entity recognition for relevance checking

3. **Ranking System**
   - Ranks sections based on relevance to persona and job
   - Uses heuristic scoring based on content analysis
   - Prioritizes sections matching user requirements

## Performance Optimizations

- Processes documents sequentially to manage memory usage
- Uses lightweight NLP model to meet size constraints
- Implements efficient text processing algorithms

## Constraints Handling

- CPU-only processing: No GPU dependencies
- Model size < 1GB: Uses compact spaCy model
- Processing time < 60s: Optimized document processing
- No internet requirement: All resources packaged in container

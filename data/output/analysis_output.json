Although French is the dominant language today, Proven\u00e7al was widely spoken until the 19th century. It is still preserved in literature, music, and local expressions. E\ufb00orts to revive and promote the language continue, with festivals and educational programs dedicated to its preservation. Literature and Poetry The South of France has inspired many writers and poets over the centuries. The troubadours of the medieval period, who composed and performed lyrical poetry, were particularly influential. Their works often celebrated chivalry, love, and nature. The region's literary heritage also includes famous authors like Marcel Pagnol, whose novels and plays vividly depict Proven\u00e7al life. Festivals and Celebrations Carnival of Nice Held in Nice from mid-February to early March, the Carnival of Nice is one of the most famous and oldest carnivals in the world. The festivities include parades with elaborate floats, street performances, and fireworks. The Battle of Flowers, where participants throw flowers into the crowd, is a highlight of the event.

Traditional Sports and Games P\u00e9tanque P\u00e9tanque is a popular game in the South of France, particularly in Provence. Played with metal balls on a gravel surface, the objective is to throw the balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called the cochonnet. P\u00e9tanque is more than just a game; it's a social activity that brings people together in village squares and parks. The relaxed atmosphere and friendly competition make it a beloved pastime. Course Camarguaise The Course Camarguaise is a traditional bullfighting sport unique to the Camargue region. Unlike Spanish bullfighting, the objective is not to harm the bull but to remove ribbons and other decorations from its horns. The razeteurs, or participants, demonstrate agility and bravery as they dodge the bull's charges. The sport is deeply rooted in local culture and is often accompanied by music and festivities, particularly in Arles from April to October. Culinary Traditions Proven\u00e7al Cuisine Proven\u00e7al cuisine is characterized by its use of fresh, local ingredients and Mediterranean flavors. Olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and basil are staples in Proven\u00e7al dishes. Some iconic dishes include ratatouille, a vegetable stew; bouillabaisse, a fish soup; and tapenade, an olive spread. Proven\u00e7al cuisine reflects the region's agricultural heritage and its emphasis on simple, flavorful cooking. Wine and Vineyards The South of France is renowned for its wine production, with regions such as Provence, Languedoc, and the Rh\u00f4ne Valley producing some of the finest wines in the world. Wine is an integral part of the local culture, and vineyards often host tours and tastings. The tradition of winemaking dates back to Roman times, and the region's diverse terroir contributes to a wide variety of wine styles. Tru\ufb04e Hunting",
